2007-08-02 17:56 +0000 [r77942]  Steve Murphy <murf@digium.com>

	* fskmodem.c: This patch hopefully solves 10141; The user is
	  running with it, and it doesn't appear to harm asterisk's
	  operation, and may prevent a crash. I'll store it in 1.2, as we
	  have shut down support on 1.2, but since I developed the patch
	  before support finished, and it might affect 1.4 and trunk, I'm
	  going ahead with it.

	* contrib/scripts/ast_grab_core: This probably isn't super-general,

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: When processing full frames, take sequence
	  number wraparound into account when deciding whether or not we
	  need to request retransmissions by sending a VNAK. This code
	  could cause VNAKs to be sent erroneously in some cases, and to
	  not be sent in other cases when it should have been. (closes
	  issue #10237, reported and patched by mihai)

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: When traversing the queue of frames for
	  possible retransmission after receiving a VNAK, handle sequence
	  number wraparound so that all frames that should be retransmitted
	  actually do get retransmitted. (issue #10227, reported and
	  patched by mihai)

	* channels/chan_skinny.c: Properly check for the length in the
	  skinny packet to prevent an invalid memcpy. (ASA-2007-016)

	* channels/iax2-parser.h, channels/chan_iax2.c,
	  channels/iax2-parser.c: Ensure that when encoding the contents of
	  an ast_frame into an iax_frame, that the size of the destination
	  buffer is known in the iax_frame so that code won't write past
	  the end of the allocated buffer when sending outgoing frames.
	  (ASA-2007-014)

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: After parsing information elements in IAX
	  frames, set the data length to zero, so that code later on does
	  not think it has data to copy. (ASA-2007-015)

2007-07-16 20:46 +0000 [r75251-75304]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* res/res_musiconhold.c: Fix a couple potential minor memory leaks.
	  load_moh_classes() could return without destroying the loaded
	  configuration.

2007-07-13 20:10 +0000 [r75066]  Mark Michelson <mmichelson@digium.com>

	* apps/app_chanspy.c: Fixed an issue where chanspy flags were
	  uninitialized if no options were passed. What triggered this
	  investigation was an IRC chat where some people's quiet flags
	  were set while others' weren't even though none of them had
	  specified the q option.

2007-07-13 20:07 +0000 [r75052-75059]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* res/res_musiconhold.c: Ensure that adding a user to the list of
	  users of a specific music on hold class is not done at the same
	  time as any of the other operations on this list to prevent list
	  corruption. Using the global moh_data lock for this is not ideal,
	  but it is what is used to protect these lists everywhere else in
	  the module, and I am only changing what is necessary to fix the
	  bug.

	* channels/chan_zap.c: (closes issue #9660) Reported by: mmacvicar
	  Patches submitted by: bbryant, russell Tested by: mmacvicar,
	  marco, arcivanov, jmhunter, explidous When using a TDM400P (and
	  probably other analog cards) there was a chance that you could
	  hang up and pick the phone back up where it has been long enough
	  to be not considered a flash hook, but too soon such that the
	  device reports that it is busy and the person on the phone will
	  only hear silence. This patch makes chan_zap more tolerant of
	  this and gives the device a couple of seconds to succeed so the
	  person on the phone happily gets their dialtone.

2007-07-12 15:51 +0000 [r74814]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* res/res_musiconhold.c: Only print out a warning for situations

2007-07-11 22:53 +0000 [r74766]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: The function make_trunk() can fail and
	  return -1 instead of a valid new call number. Fix the uses of
	  this function to handle this instead of treating it as the new
	  call number. This would cause a deadlock and memory corruption.
	  (possible cause of issue #9614 and others, patch by me)

2007-07-11 21:12 +0000 [r74719]  Mark Michelson <mmichelson@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_agent.c: The cli command "agent logoff Agent/x
	  soft" did not work...at all. Now it does. (closes issue #10178,
	  reported and patched by makoto, with slight modification for 1.4
	  and trunk by me)

2007-07-11 18:33 +0000 [r74656]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* res/res_config_odbc.c: Make sure that the ESCAPE immediately

2007-07-11 17:15 +0000 [r74587]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

2007-07-10 19:57 +0000 [r74373-74427]  Jason Parker <jparker@digium.com>

	* apps/app_queue.c: Fix an issue where it was possible to have a
	  service level of over 100% Between the time recalc_holdtime and
	  update_queue was called, it was possible that the call could have
	  been hungup. Move both additions to the same place, so this won't
	  happen. Issue 10158, initial patch by makoto, modified by me.

	* channels/chan_agent.c: Fix an issue with wrapuptime not working
	  when using AgentLogin. Issue 10169, patch by makoto, with a minor
	  mod by me to not re-break issue 9618

	* dns.c: Use res_ndestroy on systems that have it. Otherwise, use
	  res_nclose. This prevents a memleak on NetBSD - and possibly
	  others. Issue 10133, patch by me, reported and tested by scw

	  properly fall back to the channel's music class or the default.
	  (issue #10123, reported by blitzrage, patches from juggie, qwell,
	  and me)

2007-07-09 20:18 +0000 [r74158]  Jason Parker <jparker@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_zap.c: Several chan_zap options were not working on
	  reload because they were arbitrarily disallowed when reloading
	  some/most PRI options (such as signalling) was disallowed.
	  Options such as polarityonanswerdelay and answeronpolarityswitch
	  can safely be changed on a reload. This corrects that behavior.
	  Issue 9186, patch by tzafrir.

2007-07-06 23:01 +0000 [r73678-73768]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: If a sip_pvt struct has already registered
	  an extension state callback, remove the old one before adding a
	  new one. If this isn't done, Asterisk will crash. (issue #10120)

	* res/res_config_odbc.c: (closes issue #10075) Reported by: apsaras
	  Patches submitted by: Corydon76 Tested by: apsaras Fix a problem

	  an escape character.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: (closes issue #10125) Reported by: makoto
	  Patches submitted by: makoto This fixes a crash in chan_sip that
	  happens when the bindaddr setting is not valid on Asterisk
	  startup, gets fixed, and then a reload gets issued.

2007-07-06 15:26 +0000 [r73674]  Mark Michelson <mmichelson@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_agent.c: Fixed a bug wherein agents get stuck busy.

2007-07-05 22:11 +0000 [r73547]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: we shouldn't allow G.723.1 endpoints to use

2007-07-05 19:15 +0000 [r73315-73466]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Copy language information to the dialog

	  started on the dialed channel. (issue #10121 reported by
	  clegall_proformatique)

	* apps/app_chanspy.c, channel.c: Tweak spy locking. (issue #9951
	  reported by welles)

	* channels/chan_local.c: Actually check to make sure a PBX was
	  started on one of the Local channels instead of blindly assuming
	  it was. (issue #10112 reported by makoto)

	* apps/app_queue.c: Reset ServicelevelPerf variable back to 0 if we
	  are unable to calculate it each time... otherwise we will get
	  previous values. (issue #10117 reported by noriyuki)

2007-07-04 14:50 +0000 [r73207-73252]  Christian Richter <christian.richter@beronet.com>

	* channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c: bchannel configurations like
	  echocancel and volume control, need to be setuped on inbound
	  calls too.

	* channels/chan_misdn.c: bad bug in overlapdial case, we called
	  start_pbx multiple times, because the state wasn't changed..

2007-07-03 12:34 +0000 [r73052]  Tilghman Lesher <tilghman@mail.jeffandtilghman.com>

	* apps/app_dial.c: RetryDial should accept a 0 argument, but it
	  does not, because atoi does not distinguish between 0 and error
	  (closes issue #10106)

2007-07-03 08:04 +0000 [r73004]  Christian Richter <christian.richter@beronet.com>

2007-07-02 17:58 +0000 [r72924]  Jason Parker <jparker@digium.com>

2007-07-01 23:51 +0000 [r72805]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* pbx/pbx_spool.c: When appending lines to call files to keep track
	  of retries, write a leading newline just in case the original
	  call file did not have a newline at the end. This fix is in
	  response to a problem I saw reported on the asterisk-users
	  mailing list.

2007-06-29  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* Asterisk 1.2.20 released

2007-06-29 16:30 +0000 [r72629]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Backport changes that make chan_iax2 not
	  start the PBX on an incoming channel until the three-way call
	  setup is completed. These changes are already in 1.4 and trunk.

2007-06-29 13:08 +0000 [r72585]  Christian Richter <christian.richter@beronet.com>

	* channels/chan_misdn.c, channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c: check if the
	  bchannel stack id is already used, if so don't use it a second
	  time. Also added a release_chan lock, so that the same chan_list
	  object cannot be freed twice. chan_misdn does not crash anymore
	  on heavy load with these changes.

2007-06-27 23:24 +0000 [r72378]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* apps/app_mixmonitor.c: Update documentation to clarify variable

2007-06-27 23:22 +0000 [r72333-72373]  Brett Bryant <bbryant@digium.com>

	* asterisk.c: Reinstating patch. This actually fixes the problem,
	  however I was running a development branch without it and
	  mistakenly thought it wasn't fixed. Fixes issue #10010, and
	  #9654: 100% CPU usage caused by an asterisk console losing it's
	  controlling terminal.

	* asterisk.c: Reverted changes for earlier revisions 72259 to
	  72261. Issue #9654, #10010

2007-06-27 22:43 +0000 [r72327]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

2007-06-27 21:06 +0000 [r72267]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* pbx/pbx_config.c: Fix a minor issue with parsing the priority
	  number. You could have as much whitespace as you want around a
	  numeric priority, but you couldn't have any whitespace around a
	  special priority like "n" or "hint". (issue #10039, reported by
	  mitheloc, fixed by me)

2007-06-27 20:43 +0000 [r72259]  Brett Bryant <bbryant@digium.com>

2007-06-27 20:23 +0000 [r72256]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* channel.c: I may possibly get shot for doing this... but... defer
	  CDR processing until after the channel has been dealt with. This
	  should eliminate all of the issues with channels going funky
	  (SIP/PRI) when you are posting CDRs to a database that is either
	  slow or unavailable and do not want to enable batching.

2007-06-27 18:40 +0000 [r72184]  Jason Parker <jparker@digium.com>

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: Fix another problem in voicemail with

2007-06-27 13:22 +0000 [r72040-72099]  Christian Richter <christian.richter@beronet.com>

	* channels/misdn/isdn_lib.h, channels/chan_misdn.c,
	  channels/misdn/isdn_msg_parser.c, channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c:
	  simplified generation for dummy bchannels, also we mark them as
	  dummies, so they are not used later as real-bchannels, optimized
	  the RESTART mechanisms, we block a channel now on cause:44, and
	  send out a RESTART automatically, then on reception of
	  RESTART_ACKNOWLEDGE we unblock the channel again.

	* channels/misdn/isdn_lib.h, channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c: simplified
	  channel finding and locking a lot. removed unnecessary #ifdefed
	  areas.

	* channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c: isdn_lib.c didn't compile

	* channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c: for inbound TE calls, we setup the
	  bchannel when we get the CONNECT_ACKNOWLEDGE, to make sure mISDN
	  has everything ready. removed some #if 0 areas which weren't used
	  anymore.

	* asterisk.c: Fixed infinite loop when controlling terminal was
	  lost and return value of input function wasn't checked for

2007-06-21 22:29 +0000 [r70948]  Steve Murphy <murf@digium.com>

	* cdr.c: This little fix is in response to bug 10016, but may not
	  cure it. The code is wrong, clearly. In a situation where you set
	  the CDR's amaflags, and then ForkCDR, and then set the new CDR's
	  amaflags to some other value, you will see that all CDRs have had
	  their amaflags changed. This is not good. So I fixed it.

	* cdr/cdr_custom.c: it was pointed out that the cdr_custom config
	  load could get a lock, and under certain circumstances, would
	  never release it. I also noted that the situation where more than

	  properly.

	* channels/misdn/isdn_lib.h, channels/chan_misdn.c,
	  channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c: on receiption of cause:44 we mark the
	  channel as in use and inform the user about the situation, we
	  need to test the RESTART stuff then. Also shuffled the
	  empty_chan_in_stack function after the bchannel cleaning
	  functions, to avoid race conditions.

2007-06-19 18:07 +0000 [r70053]  Steve Murphy <murf@digium.com>

	* channel.c: This fixes 9246, where channel variables are not
	  available in the 'h' exten, on a 'ZOMBIE' channel. The fix is to

	  copy the merged variables back onto the clone, so the zombie has
	  the same vars that the 'original' has.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Backport fix for crashes related to
	  subscriptions from 1.4 ... Fix a crash that could occur when
	  handing device state changes. When the state of a device changes,
	  the device state thread tells the extension state handling code
	  that it changed. Then, the extension state code calls the
	  callback in chan_sip so that it can update subscriptions to that
	  extension. A pointer to a sip_pvt structure is passed to this
	  function as the call which needs a NOTIFY sent. However, there
	  was no locking done to ensure that the pvt struct didn't
	  disappear during this process. (issue #9946, reported by
	  tdonahue, patch by me, patch updated to trunk to use the sip_pvt
	  lock wrappers by eliel)

2007-06-14 20:56 +0000 [r69347]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channel.c: Backport rev 69010 from the 1.4 branch ... In
	  ast_channel_make_compatible(), just return if the channels' read
	  and write formats already match up. There are code paths that
	  call this function on a pair of channels multiple times. This
	  made calls fail that were using g729 in some cases. The reason is
	  that codec_g729a will unregister itself from the list of
	  available translators will all licenses are in use. So, the first
	  time the function got called, the right translation path was
	  allocated. However, the second time it got called, the code would
	  not find a translation path to/from g729 and make the call fail,
	  even if the channel actually already had a g729 translation path
	  allocated. (SPD-32)

	  no matter what.

2007-06-12 08:35 +0000 [r68732-68887]  Christian Richter <christian.richter@beronet.com>

	* channels/chan_misdn.c: if the bridged partner is mISDN too we
	  should not send dtmf tones, they are transmitted inband always

	* channels/chan_misdn.c: if we have already some digits, we just
	  stop the tones.

	* channels/chan_misdn.c, channels/misdn/isdn_msg_parser.c: added
	  check for NULL Pointer when calling misdn_new. Asterisk does not
	  allow us to create channels anymore when stop gracefully is used

	* channels/misdn/chan_misdn_config.h: briding is a bool, fixed copy
	  and paste issue.

	* channels/chan_misdn.c: simplified the EVENT_SETUP handling in the
	  cb_events function a lot. Commented the different possibilities a
	  bit and made functions of shared code. When the dialed extension

	* apps/app_dial.c, include/asterisk/cdr.h, cdr.c: This update will
	  fix the situation that occurs as described by 9717, where when
	  several targets are specified for a dial, if any one them reports
	  FAIL, the whole call gets FAIL, even though others were ringing
	  OK. I rearranged the priorities, so that a new disposition, NULL,
	  is at the lowest level, and the disposition get init'd to NULL.
	  Then, next up is FAIL, and next up is BUSY, then NOANSWER, then
	  ANSWERED. All the related set routines will only do so if the
	  disposition value to be set to is greater than what's already
	  there. This gives the intended effect. So, if all the targets are
	  busy, you'd get BUSY for the call disposition. If all get BUSY,
	  but one, and that one rings is not answered, you get NOANSWER. If
	  by some freak of nature, the NULL value doesn't get overridden,
	  then the disp2str routine will report NOANSWER as before.

	* devicestate.c: Only perform stripping of - strings from the
	  channel name for Zap channels. Anywhere else we might remove a
	  legitimate part of a device name. (issue #9668 reported by
	  stevedavies)

2007-05-11 16:31 +0000 [r63903]  Tilghman Lesher <tilghman@mail.jeffandtilghman.com>

	* Makefile, contrib/scripts/safe_asterisk: Issue 9121 - fixups for
	  safe_asterisk script

2007-05-10 23:14 +0000 [r63828]  Jason Parker <jparker@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Fix an issue with trying to kill a thread
	  before it gets created. Issue 9709, patch by nic_bellamy.

2007-05-10 20:38 +0000 [r63748]  Olle Johansson <oej@edvina.net>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Do not allocate SIP pvt's for PEERs we can
	  not reach. This was seen as a lot of dialogs being created then
	  immediately destroyed at reload/restart of the SIP channel.

2007-05-09 17:20 +0000 [r63653]  Matthew Fredrickson <creslin@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_zap.c: Make sure we only create a DSP if it's
	  requested on SUB_REAL

2007-05-09 16:51 +0000 [r63610]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Properly handle hints that point to multiple
	  devices in chan_sip. Why chan_sip is even doing this I have no
	  idea but I would rather not go into a rant. (issue #9536 reported
	  by rlister)

2007-05-09 14:48 +0000 [r63565]  Tilghman Lesher <tilghman@mail.jeffandtilghman.com>

	* apps/app_directory.c: Replicate fix from 51158 (app_voicemail) to
	  app_directory (Issue 9224)

2007-05-09 11:26 +0000 [r63519]  Christian Richter <christian.richter@beronet.com>

	* channels/chan_misdn.c: release_chan frees ch, so we should never
	  touch ch after release_chan, this may cause segfaults.

2007-05-08 22:19 +0000 [r63477]  Tilghman Lesher <tilghman@mail.jeffandtilghman.com>

	* apps/app_macro.c: Issue 9602 - segfault in app_macro

2007-05-08 15:07 +0000 [r63402]  Christian Richter <christian.richter@beronet.com>

	* channels/chan_misdn.c, channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c: added
	  application misdn_check_l2l1 which tries to pull up the L1/L2 on
	  all ports that have the layers down in a group. It waits then for
	  a timeout. This helps for scenarios where multiple PMP BRIs are
	  grouped together, or where a provider has a faulty PTP
	  Implementation, that looses the L2 after a while.

2007-05-08 06:20 +0000 [r63359]  Tilghman Lesher <tilghman@mail.jeffandtilghman.com>

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: Issue 9527 - upon entering a folder, no
	  message is selected (curmsg == -1), so deleting causes memory
	  corruption (beyond bounds)

2007-05-07 21:39 +0000 [r63285]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* include/asterisk/app.h, app.c, channel.c: Properly handle what
	  happens during a masquerade in relation to group counting. (issue
	  #9657 reported by ramonpeek)

2007-05-07 14:06 +0000 [r63195]  Olle Johansson <oej@edvina.net>

	* config.c: Releasing the whole in-memory configuration while
	  you're adding to it is not a good thing. Please review this
	  change. Caused by additions (+) to non-existing contexts.

2007-05-03 16:42 +0000 [r62987]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: When a peer is seeded or built tell the
	  devicestate core to update it's status. This is easier then
	  having chan_sip load before pbx_config. (issue #9658 reported by
	  dlynes)

2007-05-03 15:39 +0000 [r62885-62945]  Christian Richter <christian.richter@beronet.com>

	* channels/chan_misdn.c, channels/misdn/isdn_msg_parser.c: when
	  we're in state WAITING4DIGS, we use the asterisk tone-generator
	  which prods us, so we can't just return -1 in misdn_write in this
	  case. Added a MISDN_KEYPAD channel variable, and fixed the
	  sending of keypad. this enables us to modify the call forward
	  parameters in the switch.

	* channels/chan_misdn.c, channels/misdn/isdn_msg_parser.c: fixed
	  the problem that misdn_write did not return -1 when called with 0
	  samples in a frame this resultet in a deadlock in some
	  circumstances, when the call ended because of a busy extension.
	  added encoding of keypad.

	* res/res_config_odbc.c: doh... initializing the pointer variable
	  will work just a bit better

	* res/res_config_odbc.c: increase reliability and efficiency of
	  static Realtime config loading via ODBC: don't request fields we
	  aren't going to use don't request sorting on fields that are
	  pointless to sort on explicitly request the fields we want,
	  because we can't expect the database to always return them in the
	  order they were created (reported by blitzrage in person (!),
	  patch by me)

2007-05-02 20:10 +0000 [r62737]  Steve Murphy <murf@digium.com>

	* cdr.c, pbx.c: Some tweaks to satisfy CDR bug 8796, where being in
	  'h' extension louses up the dst field

2007-05-02 17:38 +0000 [r62691]  Tilghman Lesher <tilghman@mail.jeffandtilghman.com>

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Issue 9638 - if a text frame is sent with
	  no terminating NULL through a bridged IAX connection, the remote
	  end will receive garbage characters tacked onto the end.

2007-05-01 21:55 +0000 [r62496-62547]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* res/res_features.c: Remove an unnecessary check that makes it so
	  if you hang up after doing an attended transfer before the target
	  extension answers the channel, the transfer is not successful.
	  (issue #9338, patch by svanlund)

	* configs/indications.conf.sample: Add indications.conf information
	  for the Philippines. (issue #9525, reported and patched by
	  loloski)

2007-04-30 15:57 +0000 [r62417]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_zap.c: This patch fixes an issue where depending on
	  the cause code, when the network sends a PRI disconnect, the call
	  may not be properly hung up. (issue #9588, reported and patched
	  by softins)

2007-04-30 14:34 +0000 [r62368]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* asterisk.c: Update copyright notice. It's now the year 2007!

2007-04-27 16:16 +0000 [r62173]  Jason Parker <jparker@digium.com>

	* codecs/codec_zap.c: This transcoder message needn't be a NOTICE.
	  I've seen it cause confusion more than a few times.

2007-04-27 13:57 +0000 [r62126]  Olle Johansson <oej@edvina.net>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Issue #7351 - SIP Cancel fails due to the
	  wrong contact uri. Reported by PPYY, failed to fix by OEJ final
	  fix by wojtekka - THANKS!!!! THis was a hard one to catch.

2007-04-26 16:30 +0000 [r61958-62037]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Revert previous fix for when the IAX2
	  channel goes funky (that's the technical term). This is causing
	  legit calls to be prematurely hung up. (issue #9600 reported by
	  justdave)

	* config.c: Don't count failed include attempts against the
	  configuration include level. (issue #9593 reported by mostyn)

2007-04-25 22:24 +0000 [r61913]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_zap.c: handle a very bizarre race condition with
	  channels being redirected before a simple switch can be started
	  on them (issue #9286)

2007-04-25 21:55 +0000 [r61862-61866]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: If the callerid= option is specified, but
	  empty, clear any previous data.

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Ensure that callerid settings are reset on
	  a reload.

2007-04-25 18:52 +0000 [r61804]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* include/asterisk/app.h, funcs/func_groupcount.c, app.c,
	  apps/app_groupcount.c, channel.c: Merge rewritten group counting
	  support. No more storing data on the variable list of the
	  channels. That was bad, mmmk? (issue #7497 reported by sabbathbh)

2007-04-25 16:20 +0000 [r61798]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_zap.c: Fix a typo where cid_num got copied instead
	  of cid_ani. (issue #9587, reported and patched by xrg)

2007-04-24  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* Asterisk 1.2.18 released

2007-04-24 21:33 +0000 [r61786]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* manager.c: Don't crash if a manager connection provides a
	  username that exists in manager.conf but does not have a
	  password, and also requests MD5 authentication. (ASA-2007-012)

2007-04-24 18:20 +0000 [r61776-61777]  Dwayne M. Hubbard <dhubbard@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_phone.c, channels/chan_zap.c,
	  channels/chan_modem.c: removed #if 0 block from chan_phone,
	  chan_zap, and chan_modem restart_monitor()

	* channels/chan_modem.c: removed pthread_join in restart_monitor()
	  to make it like chan_zap and other channel drivers

2007-04-24 16:05 +0000 [r61771]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Allow RFC2833 to be sent in the response SDP
	  when an INVITE comes in without SDP. (issue #9546 reported by
	  mcrawford)

2007-04-24 13:50 +0000 [r61770]  Christian Richter <christian.richter@beronet.com>

	* channels/misdn/isdn_lib_intern.h, channels/misdn/isdn_lib.h,
	  channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c: added lock for sending messages to
	  avoid double sending. shuffled some empty_chans after the
	  cb_event calls, this avoids that a release_complete from a quite
	  different call releases a fresh created setup by accident.

2007-04-20 21:14 +0000 [r61692-61704]  Jason Parker <jparker@digium.com>

	* loader.c: Fix an issue that I noticed while looking over issue
	  9571. The reload timestamp was getting set after reloading the
	  built-in stuff, and before the modules.

	* apps/app_queue.c: If the '* to hangup' option is not enabled, we
	  don't need to disable * as a valid exit key. If it was enabled,
	  this statement would've never been checked in the first place.
	  Issue #9552

2007-04-19 07:56 +0000 [r61685]  Olle Johansson <oej@edvina.net>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Send NOTIFY to Contact: in SUBSCRIBE - as
	  reported by Intertex and Citel. Fixed during SIPit 20 in Antwerp.

2007-04-19 02:30 +0000 [r61680]  Tilghman Lesher <tilghman@mail.jeffandtilghman.com>

	* funcs/func_language.c, funcs/func_moh.c, funcs/func_groupcount.c,
	  funcs/func_timeout.c, funcs/func_cdr.c, funcs/func_callerid.c:
	  Bug 9557 - Specifying the GetVar AMI action without a Channel
	  parameter can cause Asterisk to crash. The reason this needs to
	  be fixed in the functions instead of in AMI is because Channel
	  can legitimately be NULL, such as when retrieving global
	  variables.

2007-04-16 14:08 +0000 [r61663]  Olle Johansson <oej@edvina.net>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Don't stop RTP on errors on INFO messages.
	  Disclaimer: This patch was needed for Edvina AstHoloApp and was
	  meant to be included in 1.2, but never made it in time so I felt
	  I could add it now. No, just joking, patching error found while
	  testing T.140 with Omnitor earlier this spring.

2007-04-13 19:15 +0000 [r61655]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* apps/app_dial.c: Add OUTBOUND_GROUP_ONCE variable to app_dial.
	  This behaves the same as OUTBOUND_GROUP except it will get unset
	  after use so it won't get accidentally inherited. (issue #BE-140)

2007-04-11 16:01 +0000 [r61376-61476]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: If someone sets the "useragent" option in
	  sip.conf to be empty, then don't add the User-Agent header at
	  all. It is an optional header, anyway. Also, the bug report says
	  that some of Japan's SIP providers don't allow it for some weird
	  reason. (issue #9488, reported by makoto, fixed by me)

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix a bug with switching between
	  host=dynamic and using specific hosts for peers. The code would
	  only reset the peer's address when it is dynamic if it was a new
	  peer structure. Now, it will also reset the address if it was
	  already in the peer list, but before the reload, it was not
	  dynamic. (issue #9515, reported by caio1982, fixed by me)

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Remove the attempt at reporting
	  configuration errors in sip.conf. This can cause a bunch of
	  improper messages when using realtime. I give up. As oej tried to
	  convince me when I put this in, there is just no easy way to do
	  it. (inspired by a message on the -dev list)

2007-04-11 12:05 +0000 [r61357]  Christian Richter <christian.richter@beronet.com>

	* channels/chan_misdn.c, channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c: some fixes for
	  PMP Hold/Retrieve, it should work now, when briding=no

2007-04-10 12:31 +0000 [r61170]  Nadi Sarrar <ns@beronet.com>

	* channels/misdn_config.c: msns config parameter defaults to '*'

2007-04-09 19:38 +0000 [r61038]  Olle Johansson <oej@edvina.net>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: - Don't send ActionID before Response:
	  header. - Don't use a blank in an AMI header

2007-04-09 17:22 +0000 [r60935]  Jason Parker <jparker@digium.com>

	* apps/app_directory.c: Allow matching on names shorter than 3
	  chars. This also fixes the case where somebody wants to match on
	  less then 3 chars. Issue 9071

2007-04-09 02:49 +0000 [r60846-60849]  Tilghman Lesher <tilghman@mail.jeffandtilghman.com>

	* include/asterisk.h, asterisk.c: Don't check for error when
	  lowering priority (according to the manpage, it should never
	  happen anyway). It might could happen, though, if another thread
	  messed with the priority, so safeguard against that (reported via
	  -dev list).

	* channels/chan_local.c: Bug 9505 - If the return value for
	  local_queue_frame is set, then p->lock is no longer valid.

2007-04-09 00:59 +0000 [r60797]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* apps/app_dial.c: When calling a device that then forwards us
	  elsewhere... we have to make our channels compatible if it is the
	  only channel being dialed. (issue #9445 reported by
	  marcelbarbulescu)

2007-04-08 14:00 +0000 [r60660-60711]  Tilghman Lesher <tilghman@mail.jeffandtilghman.com>

	* apps/app_macro.c: Gosub called within a Macro resets the
	  arguments improperly and causes general weirdness. (Issue 8329)

	* file.c: Bug 9486 - memory leak when opening a filestream

2007-04-06 17:03 +0000 [r60456]  Matt Frederickson <creslin@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_zap.c: There should only be one code path for doing
	  DTMF conditionals on channels. This fixes it.

2007-04-06 14:41 +0000 [r60398]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* codecs/codec_zap.c: remove undocumented 'cardsmode' parameter and
	  stop searching for transcoders during reload()

2007-04-05 16:09 +0000 [r60267]  Jason Parker <jparker@digium.com>

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: Just because we can't find the voicemail
	  configuration file, doesn't mean that the module failed to load.
	  The user could be using realtime. Issue #9473

2007-04-05 12:52 +0000 [r60213]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Only unlock our pvt and net locks if we are
	  actually going to try to lock the owner again. (issue #9472
	  reported by zoa)

2007-04-04 17:38 +0000 [r59886-60134]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* manager.c: It is valid to redirect channels via the manager
	  interface that are not in the UP state. Instead of checking for
	  that to prevent to ensure a dead channel doesn't get redirected,
	  just use the ast_check_hangup() API call. (issue #9457, reported
	  by Callmewind, patch by me) (related to issue #8977)

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix the return value of
	  handle_common_options() so that it always properly indicates
	  whether it handled the option or not. (issue #9455, reported by
	  Netview, fixed by me)

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Add a missing "\r\n" in the body of the
	  NOTIFY that is sent to indicate the status of a transfer. (issue
	  #9388, reported by rarritt)

	* mkpkgconfig: Use the more generic check for "sed -r" support that
	  was already present in 1.4. (related to issue #9399)

	* mkpkgconfig: On Darwin, the -r argument to sed is not valid. It
	  has to be -E. (issue #9399, reported by jcovert)

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Don't attempt to report configuration errors
	  in build_user(). oej pointed out that for a "friend" entry, this
	  won't work, because all user options are valid for peers, but not
	  the other way around.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Make chan_sip report when it encounters an
	  unknown option. (issue #9440, reported by nightcrawler)

	* app.c: When doing a built-in blind or attended transfer, restore
	  the ability to use '#' to terminate the number and immediately do
	  the transfer instead of having to dial the number and just wait
	  for the feature digit timeout. (issue #8366, xueliangliang)

2007-04-03 10:40 +0000 [r59788-59803]  Nadi Sarrar <ns@beronet.com>

	* channels/misdn_config.c: ptp is the 5th bit, not the 4th.

	* channels/misdn_config.c, channels/misdn/chan_misdn_config.h: Use
	  the new sysfs way of mISDN 1.2 to check if a port is NT or not.

2007-04-02 18:55 +0000 [r59723]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: Increase the maximum size for a string of
	  mailboxes to 1024. (issue #9270 reported by rtucker)

2007-04-02 12:08 +0000 [r59623-59639]  Christian Richter <christian.richter@beronet.com>

	* channels/misdn_config.c, channels/chan_misdn.c,
	  channels/misdn/chan_misdn_config.h: added option which allows us
	  to accept incoming SETUP Messages without automatically sending
	  Proceeding or Setup Acknowledge, this is useful with some broken
	  switches and if you want to Release incoming calls without
	  previously having acknowledged them. The new option is
	  noautorespond_on_setup=yes|no default is no, so we don't break
	  the existing behaviour

	* channels/chan_misdn.c: don't be verbose if no need

	* channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c: we can now make 30 channels on a PRI
	  (before we forgot chan 31..)

2007-04-01 22:35 +0000 [r59608]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* netsock.c: Add the SO_REUSEADDR flag to sockets handled by
	  netsock. This is needed by the patch that went in for issue 7874.
	  chan_iax2 needs to be able to create socket that is lisetning on
	  INADDR_ANY, but also be able to bind sockets to specific
	  addresses. (Thanks to Stevenson on the asterisk-dev mailing list
	  for explaining why this flag was needed.)

2007-03-29 17:33 +0000 [r59360]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* apps/app_meetme.c: Keep a global array of variables indicating
	  whether certain conference rooms are in use. This ensures that
	  two people going into a new dynamic conference when the 'e'
	  option is set don't go into the same conference room. (issue
	  #8835 reported by eliel)

2007-03-29 17:14 +0000 [r59355-59357]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* rtp.c: If an error occurs when reading from an RTP socket, and
	  the error code does not indicate that we should try again, then
	  return NULL instead of a "null frame". This will prevent Asterisk
	  from trying over and over again, and eventually causing the
	  system to crash. (issue #8285, john)

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Backport the change to chan_iax2 to return
	  NULL instead of a "null frame" from its read callback. See
	  revision 59341 to the 1.4 branch for more info.

2007-03-29 16:04 +0000 [r59299-59301]  Tilghman Lesher <tilghman@mail.jeffandtilghman.com>

	  field if we aren't doing anything with the information. (Plus, it
	  tends to crash the Postgres ODBC driver.)

	* res/res_odbc.c: Change ENV section to use setenv, instead of
	  putenv (Alexandru Pirvulescu <sigxcpu@gmail.com>, reported via

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Fix the use of the "sourceaddress" option
	  when "bindaddr" is set to 0.0.0.0 instead of having each
	  interface explicitly listed. (issue #7874, patch by stevens)

2007-03-27 13:56 +0000 [r59252]  Christian Richter <christian.richter@beronet.com>

	* channels/chan_misdn.c: fixed #9355

2007-03-26 10:21 +0000 [r59199]  Nadi Sarrar <ns@beronet.com>

	* channels/misdn_config.c, channels/misdn/isdn_lib.h,
	  channels/chan_misdn.c, channels/misdn/Makefile,
	  channels/misdn/chan_misdn_config.h, channels/Makefile,
	  channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c: mISDN >= 1.2 provides a dsp pipeline
	  for i.e. echo cancellation modules, make chan_misdn use it.

	  channels/chan_misdn.c, channels/misdn/chan_misdn_config.h,
	  channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c: added method standard_dec for dialing
	  out on groups, to avoid conflicts, which caused issues with some
	  ISDN providers

2007-03-13 11:45 +0000 [r58847]  Olle Johansson <oej@edvina.net>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: If we are unable to lookup the host in a c

	  reported by serginuez)

2007-03-07 18:17 +0000 [r58164-58242]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Fix a problem where the Asterisk channel
	  name could be that of the wrong IAX2 user for a call. This is
	  because the first step of choosing this name is to look for an
	  IAX2 peer that happens to have the same IP/port number that this
	  call is coming from and assuming that is it. However, this is not
	  always correct. So, I have made it change this name after
	  authentication happens since at that point, we have an exact
	  match.

	* manager.c: Fix a misplaced block of code in the 1.2 version of
	  the patch to fix issue #8977

	* manager.c: If the channels acquired using the manager Redirect
	  action are not up, then don't attempt to do anything with them.
	  It could lead to weird behavior, including crashes. (issue #8977)

2007-03-06 22:52 +0000 [r58115]  Steve Murphy <murf@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix for 9220: Eyebeam cannot renew
	  subscriptions for presence info. Reason: re-SUBSCRIBE requests
	  don't include Accept headers, which the rfc says are optional (to
	  put it tersely), (it uses MAY), and luckily, the sip_pvt struct
	  has the format info stored, so we simply leave it if the format
	  is set, and the accept header null.

2007-03-06 20:33 +0000 [r58052]  Olle Johansson <oej@edvina.net>

2007-03-06 15:17 +0000 [r58008]  BJ Weschke <bweschke@btwtech.com>

	* channels/h323/Makefile: Cleanup the Makefile so that we only
	  attempt to include a file when we're building and not 'clean'ing
	  so 'make clean' completes successfully. chan_h323 maintainer:
	  please check to make sure I haven't broken your build target.

	  present then send back an error.

2007-03-02 16:39 +0000 [r57458]  Steve Murphy <murf@digium.com>

	* pbx.c: further refinement in wording of goto documentation, as

2007-03-01 22:19 +0000 [r57317]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_local.c: Don't even attempt to optimize things when

2007-02-28 19:12 +0000 [r57118]  Steve Murphy <murf@digium.com>

	* pbx.c: a small documentation update, to reflect reality in the

2007-02-28 18:55 +0000 [r57092]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_agent.c: Fix a few more issues with the agent

2007-02-26 00:34 +0000 [r56729]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* utils.c: Ensure that lock.h is included in utils.c with
	  AST_API_MODULE defined so that the implementations will be
	  properly included when the AST_INLINE_API functions are not going
	  to be inlined. (issue #9124, festr)

2007-02-25 14:38 +0000 [r56684]  Tilghman Lesher <tilghman@mail.jeffandtilghman.com>

	* channel.c: Issue 9130 - If prev is the last item on the channel
	  list, then evaluating additional conditions (e.g. name prefix)
	  will cause a NULL dereference.

2007-02-23 23:20 +0000 [r56406-56504]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* asterisk.c: Fix up a couple more signal handlers to not do bad
	  things that could cause various undesirable results. The other
	  day, I made Asterisk deadlock by hitting Control-C because of a
	  bad signal handler. Now, signal handlers just set a flag and
	  write to an alert pipe for the flag to be handled. Then, there is
	  another thread that is monitoring for these flags. If being run
	  in console mode, it is just the main thread. If Asterisk is in
	  the background, a thread is created to do it.

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Don't destroy mutexes before unregistering
	  all of the entry points from the core. Also, fix a potential
	  memory leak from not destroying the locks for all of the possible
	  call numbers (about 32k of them).

2007-02-22 23:19 +0000 [r56230-56279]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_agent.c: Always defer Agent logoff if any channels
	  are up until they hang up. (issue #9123 reported by arbrandes)

	* channels/chan_sip.c, channel.c: Only change the original or clone
	  channel if it's the channel behind the proxy channel, not if it's
	  just a regular bridged channel.

2007-02-22 00:53 +0000 [r56010]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: If we receive a frame that is not in any of
	  the negotiated formats, then drop it. (potentially issue #8781
	  and SPD-12)

2007-02-21 20:32 +0000 [r55956]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* apps/app_meetme.c: Change naughty warning message to provide
	  useful information. If a write now fails on a channel in meetme
	  it will tell you the channel name instead of spitting out the
	  wrong error message.

2007-02-21 14:03 +0000 [r55868]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* build_tools/make_svn_branch_name: use new tag version script

2007-02-21 00:19 +0000 [r55750]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* apps/app_meetme.c, utils.c, include/asterisk/lock.h: Fix random
	  crashes when using the MeetMe application. This patch converts
	  list handling to use the linked list macros and most importantly,
	  implements reference counting on the ast_conference objects. The
	  reference counting was first backported from 1.4. However, that
	  code has some problems that caused the reference count to never
	  hit zero. Those problems are fixed in this patch and will be
	  resolved in 1.4 and trunk next, with a different patch. (issues
	  #7647, #9073, #9106, BE-115).

2007-02-20 22:39 +0000 [r55669]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_agent.c: Defer clearing callback information if
	  channels are up until they are hung up. This ensures the hangup
	  process goes smoothly and no channels get hung in limbo. (issue
	  #8088 reported by kebl0155)

2007-02-20 19:49 +0000 [r55588]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* apps/app_page.c: Convert a tab to spaces so that the
	  documentation is printed out properly aligned.

2007-02-19 18:09 +0000 [r55434]  Tilghman Lesher <tilghman@mail.jeffandtilghman.com>

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: forcename and forcegreetings options should
	  check to see if the recording already exists

2007-02-18 12:32 +0000 [r55249-55277]  Olle Johansson <oej@edvina.net>

	* apps/app_record.c: Documentation update (#9053, jsmith)

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Issue #9020 - SIP message retransmission
	  time too short. Backporting fix implemented in 1.4, where we have
	  a minimum level for the T1 timer.

2007-02-17 03:53 +0000 [r55073-55153]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* apps/app_dial.c: Answer the channel before recording privacy
	  information. (issue #8926 reported by lmamane)

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Allow chan_sip to handle attended transfers
	  from a SIP phone that is sitting behind chan_agent. Yes folks,
	  all it took was one line of code. (issue #8784 reported by
	  pzieba)

2007-02-16 22:48 +0000 [r55005]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* apps/app_meetme.c, configs/meetme.conf.sample: Revert the change
	  I did in revisions 54955, 54969, and 54970, in 1.2, 1.4, and
	  trunk. I decided that once a conference is created from
	  meetme.conf, it is acceptable behavior that the pin can not be
	  changed until the conference goes away. I also added a note in
	  meetme.conf to describe this behavior. We still have another
	  issue in 1.4 and trunk where some conferences with no users don't
	  go away. That is the real bug that needs to be addressed here.

2007-02-16 22:13 +0000 [r54999]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_agent.c: Do not send indications through
	  ast_indicate in chan_agent but instead go directly to the
	  technology. This way when indications are emulated they happen on
	  the Agent channel and do not screw up formats on the channels.
	  (issue #8439 reported by punkgode)

2007-02-16 20:56 +0000 [r54955]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* apps/app_meetme.c: For conferences that are configured in
	  meetme.conf, check the configuration file every time someone
	  joins the conference instead of only when the conference is first
	  created. This is to ensure that changes to the pin numbers in the
	  config file are always honored. (issue #9073)

	* channels/chan_zap.c: When handling glare on a PRI, move the
	  requested channel rather than hang up the old one. Fix for 8957
	  and 9011.

2007-02-13 18:35 +0000 [r54179]  Olle Johansson <oej@edvina.net>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Make sure that outbound calls are applied to

	  only in 1.2.

2007-02-08 Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	  JerJer on #asterisk-dev)

	* asterisk.c: The SIGHUP handler was implemented to allow admins to
	  send SIGHUP to a running Asterisk process to reload the
	  configuration. However, doing the actual reload in the signal
	  handler itself is a very bad thing to do, because the reload
	  process includes calling non-reentrant functions such as
	  malloc/calloc/etc. If Asterisk is running in the background, then
	  the reload will happen immediately. However, if running in
	  console mode, the reload doesn't work until something is typed at
	  the console. That sort of defeats the purpose, but I don't see an
	  easy way to get around it at this point.

	* codecs/Makefile: Comment out the parts in the Makefile that make
	  codec_zap get built. It will not yet build against zaptel 1.2, so
	  I am disabling it to prevent further bug reports until it gets
	  merged. (issue #8940)

2007-01-30 14:38 +0000 [r52843]  Christian Richter <christian.richter@beronet.com>

	* channels/chan_misdn.c, channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c: fixed some
	  possible segfaults. also fixed an very important bug which occurs
	  on high load (when calls are very fast generated)

2007-01-30 00:15 +0000 [r52762]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Fix the extraction of the timestamp from
	  video frames. It was using the mapping for a mini-frame instead
	  of a video-frame, which caused it to get invalid data. (issue
	  #8795, mihai)

2007-01-29 23:39 +0000 [r52716]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* apps/app_mixmonitor.c: Now that filename is part of the structure
	  and since it comes before postprocess... we have to add it to our
	  postprocess line. (reported on asterisk-dev by Boris Bakchiev)

2007-01-29 16:48 +0000 [r52503]  Jason Parker <jparker@digium.com>

	* codecs/codec_zap.c: Use the correct zaptel header file location.
	  Currently, this will not build - transcoder support will be added
	  to zaptel later today.

2007-01-27 02:09 +0000 [r52360-52415]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	  queue_log follow documentation. (issue #7677 reported by amilcar)

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Make the last context entry read in the
	  dominant one. (issue #8918 reported by pj)

2007-01-25 19:15 +0000 [r52162-52264]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	  by moving jitterbuffer frames check to jb_next. (issue #8546
	  reported by harmen)

	* apps/app_mixmonitor.c: Add another note about audio files being
	  played back to each bridged party. (issue #8718 reported by ppyy)

2007-01-24 17:43 +0000 [r52002]  Steve Murphy <murf@digium.com>

	* utils/check_expr.c, utils/Makefile: updated check_expr via 8322
	  (refactoring of expression checking impl); elfring contributed a
	  nice code reorg, I contributed some time to get it working again,
	  better messages

2007-01-24 10:48 +0000 [r51966]  Christian Richter <christian.richter@beronet.com>

	* channels/chan_misdn.c: fixed the busy problem (dialstatus was not
	  busy when we called a busy extension)

2007-01-24 00:57 +0000 [r51828-51843]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channel.c: Fix an issue related to synchronization of recordings
	  when using Monitor(). The bug is a miscalculation of the amount
	  to seek the stream for writing to disk when the number of samples
	  coming in and out of a channel do not match up. (issue #8298,
	  #8887, report and patch by guillecabeza, patch files created and
	  testing done by whoiswes)

	* apps/app_while.c: Don't set a new value for the END_ variable on
	  the channel before using the old value. If you do, it will lead
	  to accessing a memory address that has been free()'d. (issue
	  #8895, arkadia)

2007-01-23 01:41 +0000 [r51512]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* res/res_musiconhold.c: Yield before reading from zaptel timing
	  source under Solaris so that other threads get a chance to do
	  things. (issue #7875 reported by bob)

2007-01-22 19:39 +0000 [r51410]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* codecs/Makefile, codecs/codec_zap.c (added): Merge codec_zap
	  support for the transcoder card. This is a standalone codec
	  module so it will not affect anything else.

2007-01-22 19:08 +0000 [r51359-51406]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* apps/app_mixmonitor.c: Move filestream creation to Mixmonitor
	  loop. This will prevent a blank file from being created if no
	  frames ever pass through to be recorded. (issue #7589 reported by
	  steve_mcneil)

	* channels/chan_h323.c: Explicitly declare what codecs are
	  supported by default globally since using a bitmask for all may
	  include ones we don't need. (issue #8357 reported by
	  gknispel_proformatique)

2007-01-19 16:44 +0000 [r51300]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* asterisk.c: Fix a memory leak on command line tab completion. The
	  container for the matches was freed, but the individual matches
	  themselves were not. (issue #8851, arkadia)

2007-01-18 23:47 +0000 [r51271]  Dwayne M. Hubbard <dhubbard@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_zap.c: issue 7877: chan_zap module reload does not
	  use default/initialized values on subsequent loads. Reset
	  configuration variables to default values prior to parsing
	  configuration file.

2007-01-18 23:35 +0000 [r51269]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_zap.c: support echo cancellers that can handle 64ms
	  or 128ms of echo cancellation

2007-01-18 21:11 +0000 [r51235-51255]  Tilghman Lesher <tilghman@mail.jeffandtilghman.com>

	* stdtime/localtime.c: If a timezone is not specified, assume
	  localtime (instead of gmtime) (Issue #7748)

	* contrib/scripts/vmdb.sql: Document all the fields, including the
	  indication that "uniqueid" should not be renamed.

2007-01-17 21:17 +0000 [r51197]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Move the check for a failure of
	  ast_channel_alloc() to before locking the pvt structure again.
	  Otherwise, on a failure, this will cause a deadlock.

2007-01-17 20:52 +0000 [r51158-51194]  Tilghman Lesher <tilghman@mail.jeffandtilghman.com>

	* utils.c: When ast_strip_quoted was called with a zero-length
	  string, it would treat a NULL as if it were the quoting character
	  (and would thus return the string in memory immediately following
	  the passed-in string).

	* doc/voicemail_odbc_postgresql.txt (added): Add documentation
	  walkthrough on getting Postgres to work with voicemail (from
	  Issue 8513)

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: Postgres driver doesn't like a NULL pointer
	  when retrieving the length (Bug 8513)

2007-01-16 17:36 +0000 [r51085-51145]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* res/res_features.c: Return previous behavior. ParkedCalls will be
	  able to do DTMF based transfers again. trunk however will get an
	  option to allow this to be set on/off. (issue #8804 reported by
	  nortex)

	* channels/chan_zap.c: Add none as a valid callgroup/pickupgroup
	  option. I consider it a bug that it would inherit it all the way
	  down and not have any way to reset it to nothing - so that's why
	  it is in 1.2. (issue #8296 reported by gkloepfer)

2007-01-15 23:09 +0000 [r50987]  Tilghman Lesher <tilghman@mail.jeffandtilghman.com>

	* channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c: when we get L2 UP, the L1 is UP
	  definitely too, so we set the L1 state up as well.

	* channels/chan_misdn.c, channels/misdn/isdn_msg_parser.c,
	  channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c: * more additions to make the RESTART

2007-01-10 04:51 +0000 [r50295]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* apps/app_dial.c: Add another return value to dial_exec_full that
	  indicates execution is going to continuing at a new
	  extension/context/priority and to just let it slide. (issue #8598
	  reported by jon)

2007-01-10 02:16 +0000 [r50227]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* Makefile: Make the number that represents the major version
	  number a single digit instead of 2. Using two digits makes it an
	  octal number when put into version.h, which breaks the
	  compilation of any out of tree module that checks the version for
	  any version after 1.2.7 (reported by Matteo Brancaleoni on the

2007-01-03 08:24 +0000 [r49135-49303]  Christian Richter <christian.richter@beronet.com>

	* channels/chan_misdn.c, channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c: * Added check
	  for bridging in misdn_call to avoid setting echocancellation when
	  2 mISDN channels are involved and when bridging is set. That lead
	  to a kernel panic before under different situations, because we
	  switched about 2 times between hardware bridging and
	  echocancelation * readded MISDN_URATE variable which got lost
	  before, this should make app_v110 work again * fixed typo

	* channels/misdn_config.c, channels/misdn/isdn_lib.h,
	  channels/chan_misdn.c, configs/misdn.conf.sample,
	  channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c: added check for channel ranges in the

	  added misdn restart pid cli command. added cleaning of channel
	  when we send a RELEASE_COMPLETE.

2006-12-25 05:19 +0000 [r48939-48955]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* funcs/func_math.c: Fix an error introduced by copying and pasting
	  the handling of the >= operator for the MATH function. If a
	  single equal sign was used as an operator, the function would
	  treat it is as if it were the >= operator. Now, it properly
	  handles it as an invalid operator. (issue #8665, patch by
	  tempest1)

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Check for the proper return value on an
	  error in a call to mmap(). This was reported by Andy Wang on the
	  asterisk-dev list. Thanks!

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Remove a couple of misplaced dots in log
	  messages. This was reported by Andrea Spadaccini on the

2006-12-18 10:19 +0000 [r48552]  Christian Richter <christian.richter@beronet.com>

	* channels/chan_misdn.c, channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c: when our PTP

	  the Dial app wasn't working right. A similar bug (8386) was filed
	  and fixed earlier, but an intervening bug fix to a DTMF problem
	  broke the L() code in a different way. Hopefully, everything is

	  since that doesn't seem to be broken, I'm not going to fix it (at
	  least until someone reports it). Solution is to ask for the file
	  in smaller chunks. (Bug 8385)

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: Revert change from 8016 - this breaks other
	  stuff... Needs further review. Tip: When you've reported a bug
	  about something and somebody has put up a patch for it.. It's not
	  a good idea to open a completely new bug and say that something
	  is broken because of the patch in the other bug - PLEASE mention
	  something in the bug where the patch was actually created.

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: Fix an issue where a message isn't saved
	  correctly when using ODBC storage and reviewing a message. Issue
	  8016 - patch by sokhapkin.

	* channel.c: If the generic bridge tells us not to retry, and we
	  have a frame to spit out then break the bridge. Props to markit
	  in #asterisk-bugs for bringing this up.

2006-12-01 23:30 +0000 [r48192]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* apps/app_dial.c: if Dial() is going to send music-on-hold to the
	  calling party, it has to send PROGRESS first to ensure that the

	  to the channel driver. (issue #8390 reported by hselasky)

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Only print out debug message if bridged
	  channel is not NULL. (issue #8412 reported by jubilex)

	* res/res_features.c: Do not listen for DTMF on the bridge that
	  comes into existence when ParkedCall is executed. This means
	  native bridging can now occur for this. (issue #8406 reported by
	  kebl0155)

	* cdr.c: Print certain CDR messages out at the NOTICE level versus
	  WARNING since they can occur when used with the CDR applications
	  and are perfectly fine. (issue #8367 reported by dartvader)

	* res/res_features.c: Remember the pointer to the allocated block
	  of memory so that we can free it and not cause a memory leak.

	* rtp.c: If the frame was duplicated before writing out then we
	  need to free it. (issue #8429 reported by edguy3)

	* channels/chan_phone.c: According to the research I have done we
	  never needed to include compiler.h in the first place so let's
	  not! (issue #8430 reported by edguy3)

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: Use the proper function to get the new

2006-11-24 14:33 +0000 [r47987]  Olle Johansson <oej@edvina.net>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Change some logging levels. Not having hints
	  is not an ERROR, but still should be reported.

2006-11-23 16:10 +0000 [r47968]  Christian Richter <christian.richter@beronet.com>

	* channels/misdn_config.c, channels/chan_misdn.c,

2006-11-16 20:29 +0000 [r47750-47761]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* cdr/Makefile: Look for the header file specifically in all cases,
	  not just the existence of the directory. (issue #8358 reported by
	  mrness)

	* channels/chan_local.c: Because of the way chan_local is written
	  we should be extra careful and make sure our callback functions
	  have a tech_pvt. (issue #8275 reported by mflorell)

2006-11-16 16:44 +0000 [r47743]  Olle Johansson <oej@edvina.net>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Don't fixup if we haven't got PVT.
	  Suggestion from Martin Vit on -dev mailing list inspired by

2006-11-15 22:29 +0000 [r47711]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_local.c: Make sure that the pvt structure exists

2006-11-15 20:30 +0000 [r47666-47696]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: correct argument name typo that caused
	  global variable to be used instead of the one for the specified
	  voicemail user

	* config.c: when re-writing the config file, don't repeat the path
	  if it hasn't changed

	* config.c: when appending a list of variable to a category, ensure
	  the tail pointer points to the last variable in the list

	* config.c: clear the category's variable tail pointer as well when
	  variables are detached from it

	* config.c: ouch... don't use printf, use ast_log/ast_verbose

	* apps/app_voicemail.c, include/asterisk/config.h: ensure that
	  message duration is included in email notifications for forwarded
	  messages (BE-96, fix by me after corydon used his clue-bat on me)
	  ensure that duration in the message metadata is updated if
	  prepending is done during forwarding (related to BE-96) remove
	  prototype for API call that does not exist

2006-11-15 15:17 +0000 [r47648-47655]  Olle Johansson <oej@edvina.net>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Send error message if we fail to allocate
	  sip socket, possibly caused by too few file handles (wasn't
	  possible before, but with the new way of sending temp messages,
	  it is). Found this bug under heavy load testing with SIPP.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Sending 200 OK and not getting ACK is
	  considered critical for the call.

2006-11-14 22:15 +0000 [r47631]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: Update copyright information in the ADSI
	  logo blob.

2006-11-14 11:06 +0000 [r47596]  Olle Johansson <oej@edvina.net>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Avoid collissions between the peerpoke
	  system and the retransmits. Issue #8272. In some cases, changed
	  timers caused the retransmit system to destroy the dialog before
	  peerpoke_expire got a chance.

2006-11-13 21:26 +0000 [r47583]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

2006-11-12 06:09 +0000 [r47496]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Only do the check to determine whether the

2006-11-10 20:46 +0000 [r47452-47470]  Olle Johansson <oej@edvina.net>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Clear dialog on loop (backport from 1.4 by

	  alphaque)

2006-11-09 16:48 +0000 [r47379]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_phone.c: Don't include compiler.h on kernels 2.6.18
	  and higher as, well, it's apparently going to be removed. This
	  should make all you FC6 fans happy as your Asterisk will now
	  build without any mods.

2006-11-09 13:09 +0000 [r47359]  Christian Richter <christian.richter@beronet.com>

	* channels/misdn_config.c, channels/chan_misdn.c,

2006-11-07 01:22 +0000 [r47238]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* res/res_musiconhold.c: If random order is enabled for files mode
	  music on hold, set a random initial position, instead of always
	  starting at the first file, and doing the random operation only
	  when switching to the next file. (bug reported by John Lange on
	  the asterisk-dev mailing list)

2006-11-02 17:47 +0000 [r46964]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* res/res_musiconhold.c: ignore files in a music on hold directory

2006-11-01 19:52 +0000 [r46803]  Steve Murphy <murf@digium.com>

	* res/res_config_odbc.c: a fix for bug 8251; the var_val needs to
	  accept longer strings or mass confusion and a lot of lost time is
	  the result

2006-11-01 18:24 +0000 [r46776]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* res/res_monitor.c: soxmix and Asterisk expect different file
	  extensions for certain formats. This was already handled for the
	  wav49 format. However, it was not handled for ulaw and alaw. I
	  fixed this in such a way that using the alternate extensions for
	  ulaw and alaw will only happen if we know we're calling soxmix,
	  and not a custom script defined using the MONITOR_EXEC variable.
	  The wav49 processing was left alone so that external scripts will
	  see no behavior change. (issue #7550, reported by mnicholson,
	  proposed patch by junky, committed fix is a bit different)

2006-10-31 15:46 +0000 [r46662]  Tilghman Lesher <tilghman@mail.jeffandtilghman.com>

	* apps/app_curl.c: Move thread-unsafe initializer to the module
	  loading code; add the corresponding function to the module unload
	  to fix a memory leak.

2006-10-31 09:49 +0000 [r46585-46610]  Olle Johansson <oej@edvina.net>

	* channels/chan_sip.c, configs/sip.conf.sample: Another try to fix
	  ;rport NAT traversal support (issue #7473)

	* channels/chan_sip.c: If peer fails ACL check, fail the REGISTER
	  attempt

	* channels/chan_sip.c: On the other hand, we already copy the NAT
	  flags... Reverting.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Issue 7473 - support ;rport on REGISTER
	  requests too.

2006-10-31 06:18 +0000 [r46557-46560]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

2006-10-27 17:36 +0000 [r46361]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* res/res_agi.c, asterisk.c, apps/app_externalivr.c,
	  res/res_musiconhold.c: We should always be using _exit() after a
	  fork() or vfork() instead of exit(). This is because exit() does
	  some extra cleanup which in some implementations of vfork(), for
	  example, can actually modify the state of the parent process,
	  causing very weird bugs or crashes. (issue #7971, Nick Gavrikov)

2006-10-27 09:24 +0000 [r46350]  Christian Richter <christian.richter@beronet.com>

	* channels/misdn/isdn_lib.h, channels/chan_misdn.c,
	  channels/misdn/isdn_msg_parser.c, channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c:
	  fixed a bug which caused chan_misdn to try to allocate 2 times
	  the same channel on high load, which then caused instability of
	  mISDN. removed a useless function from isdn_lib.c

2006-10-26 20:06 +0000 [r46344]  Olle Johansson <oej@edvina.net>

2006-10-25 08:41 +0000 [r46176]  Christian Richter <christian.richter@beronet.com>

	* channels/misdn_config.c, channels/chan_misdn.c,

	  added nttimeout option to configure wether we disconnect calls on

	  and couldn't be initialized it would cause a segfault after
	  'reload'. Reported by Drew/Matt thx.

2006-10-19 17:16 +0000 [r45691]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* apps/app_externalivr.c: Respect language selection when seeing if
	  the file exists (issue #8178 reported by mnicholson)

2006-10-17 Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* Asterisk 1.2.13 released

2006-10-17 20:37 +0000 [r45380]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Don't create a "real" pvt structure for
	  requests that shouldn't be able to create one. Instead use a
	  temporary pvt and fill it with enough information so we can send
	  a reply.

2006-10-17 17:50 +0000 [r45332]  Jason Parker <jparker@digium.com>

2006-10-17 15:50 +0000 [r45306]  Olle Johansson <oej@edvina.net>

	* channels/chan_sip.c, configs/sip.conf.sample: After some
	  research, we realized that the default behaviour since a long
	  time was doing the right thing, even though the change optimized
	  a bit and removed a lot of potential risks. Conclusion: No need
	  for a configuration option at all.

2006-10-16 19:59 +0000 [r45260-45265]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c, configs/sip.conf.sample: Use responses
	  rather then replies even though they mean the same thing.

	* channels/chan_sip.c, configs/sip.conf.sample: Add
	  'ignoreoodreplies' option which will not create a pvt structure
	  on a SIP response but instead basically drop it.

2006-10-14 00:16 +0000 [r45134]  Steve Murphy <murf@digium.com>

	* pbx/pbx_ael.c: Made a small update to solve bug 8128; The

2006-09-27 16:54 +0000 [r43778]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* res/res_features.c, channel.c: Fix a problem that occurred if a
	  user entered a digit that matched a bridge feature that was
	  configured using multiple digits, and the digit that was pressed
	  timed out in the feature digit timeout period. For example, if
	  blind transfer is configured as '##', and a user presses just
	  '#'. In this situation, the call would lock up and no longer pass
	  any frames. (issue #7977 reported by festr, and issue #7982
	  reported by michaels and valuable input provided by mneuhauser
	  and kuj. Fixed by me, with testing help and peer review from
	  Joshua Colp). There are a couple of issues involved in this fix:
	  1) When ast_generic_bridge determines that there has been a
	  timeout, it returned AST_BRIDGE_RETRY. Then, when
	  ast_channel_bridge gets this result, it calls ast_generic_bridge
	  over again with the same timestamp for the next event. This
	  results in an endless loop of nothing until the call is
	  terminated. This is resolved by simply changing
	  ast_generic_bridge to return AST_BRIDGE_COMPLETE when it sees a
	  timeout. 2) I also changed ast_channel_bridge such that if in the
	  process of calculating the time until the next event, it knows a
	  timeout has already occured, to immediately return
	  AST_BRIDGE_COMPLETE instead of attempting to bridge the channels
	  anyway. 3) In the process of testing the previous two changes, I
	  ran into a problem in res_features where ast_channel_bridge would
	  return because it determined that there was a timeout. However,
	  ast_bridge_call in res_features would then determine by its own
	  calculation that there was still 1 ms before the timeout really
	  occurs. It would then proceed, and since the bridge broke out and
	  did *not* return a frame, it interpreted this as the call was
	  over and hung up the channels. The reason for this was because
	  ast_bridge_call in res_features and ast_channel_bridge in
	  channel.c were using different times for their calculations.
	  channel.c uses the start_time on the bridge config, which is the
	  time that the feature digit was recieved. However, res_features
	  had another time, 'start', which was set right before calling
	  ast_channel_bridge. 'start' will always be slightly after
	  start_time in the bridge config, and sometimes enough to round up
	  to one ms. This is fixed by making ast_bridge_call use the same
	  time as ast_channel_bridge for the timeout calculation.

	* channels/misdn/isdn_lib.h, channels/chan_misdn.c,

	* asterisk.c: Back in revision 4798, this message was changed from
	  using ast_cli() to directly calling write(). During this change,

	  this message about using "exit" or "quit" to exit an Asterisk
	  console to come up in times where it did not make sense. This
	  change restores the check to see if this is a remote console
	  before printing the message. (fixes BE-4)

	* apps/app_queue.c: Make sure the forwarded channel inherits
	  variables appropriately when we receive a call forward in the
	  queue. (#7867 - raarts reported and patched)

	* apps/app_queue.c: Don't keep trying the same member in certain
	  strategies when members of the queue are unavailable (#7278 -
	  diLLec reported and patched)

	* apps/app_chanspy.c: Let's NOT spy on Zap/psuedo channels,
	  mmmmmmmmk?

	* apps/app_queue.c: Setting a retry of 0 is generally not a good
	  idea and shouldn't be allowed. (#7574 - reported by regin)

2006-09-01 22:49 +0000 [r41768]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Only wipe the redirected audio & video
	  IP/port if it's specified, and trigger a reinvite.

2006-09-01 17:35 +0000 [r41716]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c, include/asterisk/rtp.h, rtp.c: put in proper
	  fix for issue #7294 instead of the broken partial fix that was
	  committed, and thereby also fix issue #7438

2006-09-01 16:33 +0000 [r41690-41691]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* channel.c: Finish up the last commit (was worse then originally

	  channels/chan_sip.c, channels/chan_skinny.c,
	  channels/chan_features.c, channels/chan_h323.c,
	  channels/chan_iax2.c: Restore original functionality of 1.2 in
	  places where ANI was not set, but was changed to be set. The
	  original change was done to ensure that the behavior of the
	  "callerid" option in each channel driver was consistent, but it
	  caused an unexpected behavior change of CDR records for users, so
	  this change is being reverted in 1.2. (issue #7695)

2006-08-29 13:33 +0000 [r41269]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* pbx/pbx_config.c: clean up last commit ... most notably, there is
	  no reason to do heap allocations here, and it also included a
	  potential memory leak

2006-08-29 05:49 +0000 [r41239-41262]  Steve Murphy <murf@digium.com>

	* pbx/pbx_config.c: Fixes for bug 7813, via patch submitted by
	  stevens.

	* doc/README.variables: Removed from the docs the mention of the !
	  and =~ operators, as these were knocked out of ast_expr2 because
	  they were new features. Let's hope I can keep them from getting
	  knocked out of the trunk, too!

	* apps/app_macro.c: According to a note added to 7731 by
	  mneuhauser, this will repair a break caused by the last fix
	  (7731).

2006-08-24 19:41 +0000 [r40994]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* include/asterisk/linkedlists.h, channel.c, pbx.c: Fix a few
	  issues related to the handling of channel variables - in
	  pbx_builtin_serialize_variables(), the variable list traversal
	  would stop on a variables with empty name/values, which is not
	  appropriate - When removing the GROUP variables, use
	  AST_LIST_REMOVE_CURRENT instead of AST_LIST_REMOVE - During
	  masquerading, when copying the variables list from one channel to
	  the other, using AST_LIST_INSERT_TAIL is not valid for appending
	  a whole list. It leaves the tail pointer of the list invalid.
	  Introduce a new macro, AST_LIST_APPEND_LIST that appends a list
	  properly. (issue #7802, softins)

	  none the less.

2006-08-20 22:09 +0000 [r40692]  Tilghman Lesher <tilghman@mail.jeffandtilghman.com>

2006-08-19 01:03 +0000 [r40446]  Jason Parker <jparker@digium.com>

	* apps/app_voicemail.c, apps/app_directory.c: Fix a bug with
	  app_voicemail when trying to use app_directory to leave messages
	  to another user (options 3, 5, 2). If the context/extension
	  didn't exist in the dialplan (and why should it have to?), it
	  would fail, saying that it's an "invalid extension". Fix was
	  different in svn trunk. (issue BE-71)

	  the changes from my team branch 0.3.0 into t he 1.2 branch. These
	  changes include the new mISDN mqueue interface which makes it
	  possible to compile chan_misdn against the current cvs version of

	  numerous bugfixes to chan_misdn . Each change is documented in
	  the commit logs in the team/crichter/0.3.0 branch.

2006-08-17 16:36 +0000 [r40227]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channel.c: revert bogus change to attempt to fix bug 7506 which
	  actually causes half of the channels not to get "Newchannel"
	  events at all (issue #7745)

2006-08-17 16:22 +0000 [r40223-40225]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* funcs/func_cdr.c: Use the last CDR entry instead of the first CDR
	  entry for variable retrieving variables using the CDR dialplan
	  function. (issue #7689 reported by voipgate)

	* apps/app_macro.c: Make app_macro compile again

2006-08-17 16:07 +0000 [r40220]  Steve Murphy <murf@digium.com>

	* apps/app_macro.c: In app_macro, changed the previously changed
	  upper recursion depth limit to a variable, default of the
	  original val of 7. MACRO_RECURSION is a channel variable that
	  will override the limit, but until I can understand and fix why
	  this limit is neccessary, I am not advertising this variable in
	  the docs. This fix mirrors the changes made in r40200 in trunk.

2006-08-16 18:57 +0000 [r40057]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_mgcp.c: don't allow AUEP responses to overflow the
	  stack during a string copy (reported by Mu Security)

2006-08-15 22:49 +0000 [r39935]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* res/res_agi.c: use pbx_builtin_getvar_helper() so that GET
	  VARIABLE can retrieve global variables (issue #7609)

2006-08-15 22:13 +0000 [r39931]  Steve Murphy <murf@digium.com>

	* apps/app_macro.c: This revision fixes bug 7731, the inability for
	  macros to be called more than one level deep in the 'h'
	  extension. It also pushes up the limit of recursion depth from 7
	  to 20.

2006-08-08 18:39 +0000 [r39379]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* CREDITS: add explicit listing of anthm's contributions (issue
	  #7683)

2006-08-08 17:04 +0000 [r39350]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Increase the buffer size for the callid
	  (issue #7675, reported by pssatcs)

2006-08-07 01:28 +0000 [r39081]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_zap.c: Fix a crash reported to me by hads on IRC.
	  This crash would occur with the use of the
	  "distinctiveringaftercid" option. Also, on this user's system,
	  the crash would only occur when built without optimizations. This
	  is because the bug is that the code would write past the end of
	  an array that was allocated on the stack, and the structure of
	  the stack is different with or without optimizations enabled.

2006-08-07 00:15 +0000 [r39056]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* channel.c: Reset our stream and vstream pointers back to NULL so
	  that any generator that uses them (file based MOH) will not try
	  to close them again. (issue #7668 reported by jmls)

2006-08-05 09:01 +0000 [r38903-38982]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channel.c: Always generate a Newstate event in ast_setstate()
	  instead of making it a Newchannel event if the state was
	  AST_STATE_DOWN. The Newchannel event will always be generated in
	  ast_request(), so this just causes a duplicated Newchannel event
	  in some cases. (issue #7506, repoted by capouch, fixed by me)

	* apps/app_queue.c: remove duplicate queue log entry when the
	  caller exits on a timeout (issue #7616, ppyy)

	* channels/chan_sip.c: don't advertise that this function can set a
	  SIP header when it can only do reads

	* apps/app_dial.c: make sure the priv-callerintros directory exists
	  before trying to create a file there (issue #7659, patch by hads,
	  with some modifications by me)

	* channels/chan_mgcp.c, channels/chan_vpb.c, channels/chan_phone.c,
	  channels/chan_misdn.c, channels/chan_zap.c, channels/chan_sip.c,
	  channels/chan_skinny.c, channels/chan_h323.c,
	  channels/chan_modem.c, channels/chan_iax2.c: Fix an issue that
	  would cause a NewCallerID manager event to be generated before
	  the channel's NewChannel event. This was due to a somewhat recent
	  change that included using ast_set_callerid() where it wasn't
	  before. This function should not be used in the channel driver
	  "new" functions. (issue #7654, fixed by me) Also, fix a couple
	  minor bugs in usecount handling. chan_iax2 could have increased
	  the usecount but then returned an error. The place where chan_sip
	  increased the usecount did not call ast_update_usecount()

	* channel.c: suppress a compiler warning about the usage of a
	  potentially uninitialized variable

2006-08-03 19:54 +0000 [r38825]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* res/res_musiconhold.c: Treat the file as invalid if we have no
	  valid formats for it (issue #7643 reported by KNK)

2006-08-03 05:22 +0000 [r38761]  Tilghman Lesher <tilghman@mail.jeffandtilghman.com>

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: Bug 7648 - Checking wrong count for
	  plurality on new messages for Dutch language

2006-08-02 19:29 +0000 [r38686-38731]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: fix brain-damage I introduced when trying to
	  fix the CANCEL/BYE sending mechanism for pending INVITES accept
	  unknown 1xx responses as 183 responses (as RFC3261 mandates we
	  should do)

	* res/res_features.c, channel.c: ensure that the 'feature digit
	  timeout' value is taken into account when deciding how long the
	  bridge should run (this fixes a problem report where a digit
	  press that did not invoke a feature is never passed across the
	  bridge)

2006-08-01 19:20 +0000 [r38654]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* res/res_musiconhold.c: Close the stream when file based MOH stop.
	  This won't get rid of their position in the file but it will
	  cause the translation path to be setup again. (issue #7634
	  reported by asimpson)

2006-07-31 21:14 +0000 [r38611]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: don't reissue hangup requests for SIP
	  channels that have expired their RTP timeouts (one time is
	  enough) don't rescan the SIP private structure list too fast, it
	  can cause channels to not be able to hang up (issue #7495, and
	  probably others) use ast_softhangup_nolock() since we already
	  hold the channel's lock

2006-07-31 17:09 +0000 [r38585]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* res/res_features.c: Add missing code to bring transferee channel
	  out of MOH/autoservice under certain circumstance (issue #7611
	  reported by guillecabeza with minor mods by myself)

2006-07-31 04:06 +0000 [r38546-38547]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* frame.c: one more small tweak for thread-safety of TRACE_FRAMES

	* frame.c: Make the frame counting done with TRACE_FRAMES defined
	  thread-safe

2006-07-29 23:18 +0000 [r38501]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: How many attempts does it take to make a SIP
	  URI parser that works well? I'm up to 5 personally. On to the
	  good stuff - parse the domain first, user second, and get rid of
	  port & options/params last. (issue #7616 reported by andrew)

2006-07-28 18:49 +0000 [r38420]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Make a copy of the request URI in
	  check_user_full instead of modifying the one on the structure,
	  and also strip params properly from the user portion of the SIP
	  URI so as to preserve the domain (issue #7552 reported by dan42)

2006-07-27 22:23 +0000 [r38347-38370]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* apps/app_chanspy.c: use the enum that defines the option
	  arguments, so that the likelihood of mismatched option indexes is
	  reduced (which in this case was a bug, the volume argument was
	  not checked properly)

	* channel.c: do a better job avoiding translation path
	  teardown/setup when not needed

2006-07-27 04:25 +0000 [r38328]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Fix crash when using the "regexten" option
	  with MALLOC_DEBUG enabled. This was not reported in the bug
	  tracker but the same bug has been demonstrated in other places in
	  the code.

2006-07-27 02:43 +0000 [r38310]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* channel.c: don't do useless translation destroy/build when the
	  channel is already in the correct format

2006-07-27 01:58 +0000 [r38288]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: fix a crash when MALLOC_DEBUG is enabled and
	  the regexten is enabled. The crash would occur when the extension
	  got removed. (fixes issue #7484)

2006-07-26 15:26 +0000 [r38234]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Put default callerid into contact when the
	  one specified is either NULL or has a zero string length. (issue
	  #7590 reported by key2)

2006-07-25 19:43 +0000 [r38200]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_zap.c: This resolves a deadlock that a tech support
	  customer was getting frequently when his users would answer call
	  waiting. If another thread is currently holding the zt_pvt lock
	  for the first channel, unlock both channels and let asterisk
	  retry the native bridge, just like what is done for the second
	  channel directly below these changes.

2006-07-24 17:05 +0000 [r38167]  Steve Murphy <murf@digium.com>

	* codecs/gsm/Makefile: This fixes a compile problem for s390 as
	  reported in bug 7253. Tested on both an s390 and non-s390
	  machine.

2006-07-19 17:10 +0000 [r37949]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: ensure that global 'maxauthreq' is reset to
	  zero during 'reload'

2006-07-18 00:41 +0000 [r37828-37856]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* frame.c: don't crash if the frame has no data, but has a src

	* frame.c: if asked to duplicate a frame that has no data, don't
	  set the frame's data pointer past the end of the allocatted
	  buffer for the new frame

2006-07-17 22:36 +0000 [r37765-37808]  Tilghman Lesher <tilghman@mail.jeffandtilghman.com>

	* formats/format_h263.c: Backport buffer increase to 1.2

2006-07-15 23:29 +0000 [r37691]  Tilghman Lesher <tilghman@mail.jeffandtilghman.com>

	* enum.c: Bug 7513 - ensure that each time we do a query, the
	  results are returned in the same logical order, so that when we
	  iterate over the list, we get all results, not some results
	  repeated, due to insufficient sorting.

2006-07-14 Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* Asterisk 1.2.10 released

2006-07-14 13:31 +0000 [r37612]  Tilghman Lesher <tilghman@mail.jeffandtilghman.com>

2006-07-13 21:22 +0000 [r37571]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: don't fail/abort if the message category
	  sound file cannot be played, just generate a warning message and
	  continue message playback

2006-07-13 18:44 +0000 [r37546]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* rtp.c: yeah, ummm... This frame pointer should not be static.
	  This situation only exists in 1.2 (pointed out by Constantine
	  Filin on the asterisk-dev mailing list)

2006-07-13 16:44 +0000 [r37531]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

2006-07-12 15:53 +0000 [r37441-37442]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: fix a weird case where a lock file could be
	  left (but would happen almost never)

	* app.c: fix a case where ast_lock_path() could leave a
	  randomly-named lock file hanging around make ast_unlock_path
	  actually report when unlocking fails

2006-07-12 15:23 +0000 [r37439]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Add support to have maxauthreq as a global

2006-07-12 13:54 +0000 [r37417-37419]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_zap.c, utils.c, res/res_agi.c, apps/app_zapras.c,
	  asterisk.c, channels/chan_modem.c, channels/chan_iax2.c: remove
	  some more bad examples of using printf

	* enum.c, pbx/pbx_config.c: get rid of some more printf's (although
	  most of these were ifdef-ed out)

	  UP state (issue #7376, backported from trunk)

	* configs/iax.conf.sample, channels/chan_iax2.c: don't store

	* apps/app_queue.c: coding style cleanups on queue interface
	  handling code that was committed for the last release

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: use existing dial string parser for strings
	  supplied to iax2_devicestate, because they can be complete dial
	  strings, not just device names

	* include/asterisk/plc.h, jitterbuf.c, plc.c, apps/app_dumpchan.c,
	  apps/app_chanspy.c: clarify file headers that mention disclaimer
	  usage

	* file.c: don't output 'no format found' when we _did_ find the
	  format but couldn't open the desired file for some other reason

	* apps/app_mixmonitor.c: memory allocation optimizations

2006-06-13 12:40 +0000 [r33753-33813]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* pbx.c: remove duplicate mutex_unlock

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: fix various places where the code returns
	  without unlocking vmlock or destroying loaded configuration

	* apps/app_festival.c: add a missing close of an open fd, destroy
	  of open config, and removal of the calling channel from the
	  localusers list

	* asterisk.c: revert a change that caused more problems than it
	  fixed and fix the real problem in this code. fds was declared as
	  an array of zero size which caused some weird problems, some of
	  which would only be seen when compiling without optimizations.
	  (fixes issues #7071, #7326, and #7305)

2006-06-12 21:34 +0000 [r33724]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* include/asterisk/chanspy.h, apps/app_mixmonitor.c, channel.c:
	  Greatly simply the mixmonitor thread, and move channel reference

2006-06-12 20:40 +0000 [r33693]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* res/res_agi.c: fix a place where a frame would be free'd twice

2006-06-12 16:03 +0000 [r33638]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_local.c: only allow chan_local to masquerade the
	  outbound channel onto its owner, instead of the other way around
	  (this will ensure that group variables on the outbound channel are
	  preserved)

2006-06-12 15:27 +0000 [r33615]  Tilghman Lesher <tilghman@mail.jeffandtilghman.com>

	* res/res_agi.c: Move set priority up, because at this point in the
	  code, stdout is no longer the console. If we're unable to set
	  priority, the error goes to Asterisk as if it were an AGI command
	  (issue 7335).

2006-06-11 21:21 +0000 [r33449-33548]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* pbx.c: fix another place where a frame does not get free'd

	* apps/app_meetme.c: fix up five little places where frames would
	  not be free'd and remove an unnecessary mutex_unlock where there
	  is no way for it to be locked at that time

	* apps/app_ices.c: fix a place that would leak a frame (all of
	  these fixes are in applications that call ast_read() on a channel
	  but have code paths in them that would not free the frame)

	* apps/app_festival.c: fix a couple places that would leak a frame

	* apps/app_alarmreceiver.c: fix two places that would cause a frame
	  to be leaked

	* apps/app_url.c: fix a case where an HTML frame would be leaked

	* apps/app_test.c: Free frames read from the channel when measuring
	  noise. This resulted in about 9 or 10 seconds of leaked frames in
	  both the TestClient and TestServer applications

	* apps/app_zapbarge.c, apps/app_zapscan.c: backport a couple of
	  frame leak fixes from the trunk (revisions 33446, 33447)

2006-06-03 17:02 +0000 [r31775]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* res/res_musiconhold.c: when using moh files mode, don't look for
	  a file past the number of files that have been loaded, or worse,
	  past the size of the files array

2006-06-01 21:46 +0000 [r31321-31555]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* res/res_musiconhold.c: remove pointless forcing of the channel
	  into SLINEAR mode; the write format will be set later based on
	  the file that is chosen to be played to the channel

	* include/asterisk/channel.h, channel.c: handle Zap transfers
	  behind chan_agent properly so the agent doesn't get stuck waiting
	  for the call to hang up

	* configs/sip.conf.sample: remove a sample entry that never should
	  have been added (code to support it was not merged)

2006-05-31 23:50 +0000 [r31194]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* apps/app_queue.c: Fix infinite loop scenario and add some sanity
	  checking to prevent segfault on a NULL parameter coming in (which
	  probably shouldn't happen, but just to be safe...)

2006-05-26 17:09 +0000 [r30424-30546]  BJ Weschke <bweschke@btwtech.com>

	* apps/app_queue.c: A new way to try and deal with deadlocks that
	  occur in app_queue at present. Using this approach, we only
	  manipulate the main queue mutexes when we get a dev state change
	  on a device that is actually a member of a queue. Backported from

2006-05-25 20:03 +0000 [r30373]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

2006-05-24 19:55 +0000 [r30037]  Matt O'Gorman <mogorman@digium.com>

2006-05-23 17:17 +0000 [r29733]  BJ Weschke <bweschke@btwtech.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Sanity check code for an extended failure in
	  trying to obtain a channel lock that may have been obtained
	  elsewhere. Prevents the monitor thread of the SIP module from
	  going into an infinite loop, effectively, breaking SIP until you
	  restart Asterisk or the mutex is unlocked, whichever comes first.

2006-05-23 17:15 +0000 [r29732]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

2006-05-21 15:16 +0000 [r29196]  BJ Weschke <bweschke@btwtech.com>

	* res/res_features.c: When an application that is executed via
	  applicationmap and exits non-zero, make sure that we pass through
	  the correct return value from the application to make sure a
	  segfault doesn't occur by a bridge trying to continue when it
	  should not. Also, when executing applications via applicationmap,
	  make sure that the application is executed against the channel
	  whose DTMF caused it to be fired off in the first place. (part
	  1/2 of #7090 - this is the only fix that will be applied to both
